# Nitrogen-addition-effects-on-litter-decay

This repository records the data and code to reproduce analyses reported in our 
article about "Moderate nitrogen addition reduces soil fauna density under
high precipitation, but not soil fauna contribution to global
litter decomposition" submitted to Global Ecology and Biogeography. This
meta-analysis aims to find out globally how does N deposition affect litter 
and soil fauna abundance and diversity..
